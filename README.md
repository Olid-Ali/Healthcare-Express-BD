# Healthcare-Express-BD

Healthcare Xpress is a comprehensive healthcare management system designed to streamline and enhance the user experience for both patients and healthcare providers. This project encompasses several key functionalities that enable efficient booking and management of medical services. The Healthcare Xpress project focuses on creating a seamless, user-friendly interface for booking medical consultations and emergency services. The integration of live search, dynamic data display, and robust form handling ensures a high level of functionality and efficiency, aimed at improving the overall user experience and operational efficiency for healthcare service providers. Below is a summary of the key features and functionalities implemented so far:

1. Live Consultant Booking System
Consultant Information Display: We developed a system that fetches and displays detailed information about available consultants. This includes their name, category, meet link, time slots, and consultation fees.
User Form Integration: Users can input their personal details (name, address, email, and phone number) and view the selected consultant's details. This information is then submitted and stored in the book_consult table.

3. Emergency Ambulance Service
Live Search Functionality: Users can search for available ambulance drivers based on their location. The search results dynamically display driver details such as name, contact number, and location in a responsive Bootstrap table.
Driver Assignment: An interface allows users to select and assign a driver for emergency situations. A call button is included for immediate contact.
